This is a conversational AI that combines listening, speech & a brain - via [VertexAI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)

As part of a series of projects based on combing these mediums, I created this version try out the new [Angular 17](https://angular.dev/) as well as the experience developing for **Gemini** & **VertexAI APIs**.

This project was also the basis of a talk I did at Google Melbourne for a GDG event.

The talk was about *how to create an immersive AI experience*.

From a high level, these conversational AI tools are still in their infancy and we haven't had enough time to properly explore the optimal medium for interacting with these tools.

The talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNAv5FMgQ9Q) - I am very out of practice with public speaking but was a fun event to be at.

There's still a lot more to add to this project, like; Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) via **LangChain**, using **Gemini 1.5** for better conversations and a long term vector storage solution to remember each individual.

Fun fact: I named it **Gemini Coach** a week before the **Bard** rebrand!
