langpal is a modern phrasebook for character based languages, based on Anki.
It allows a user to create custom phrase-lists to then practice both their listening & speaking skills using advanced text to speech generation & character by character pronunciation analysis.

I made it to ease my social anxiety & fear when preparing to speak either Mandarin or Cantonese out in the public

For this project I've been getting help from [Dr Chaak-Ming Lau](https://repository.eduhk.hk/en/persons/chaak-ming%E5%8A%89%E6%93%87%E6%98%8E-lau) a Cantonese linguistics PhD and the creator of [words.hk](https://words.hk).

With his help I developed [Jyutping for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/jyutping) - a pub.dev package that allows for Chinese character to Jyutping conversion.
From a stylistic angle, this project was influenced by a fun graphic design journey I went on with exploring a new take on Alegria/Corporate Memphis.

This project will also be the basis of a talk I will be doing at Google Melbourne for Monash Universities GDG Student Group, in which students will be able to apply to get the flutter source code.

The project also leverages Flutter "Code Push" by [Eric Seidel](https://github.com/eseidel) (Creator of Flutter) & his team at [Shorebird](https://shorebird.dev/).
