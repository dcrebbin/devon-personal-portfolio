Ourland is an [Indigenous Corporation](https://register.oric.gov.au/PrintCorporationSearch.aspx?corporationName=ourland) & Non Profit Charity (status in-progress) to provide an educational resource for people to learn about Australian Indigenous land, languages & place names.

It's main goal is to prevent the extinction of Indigenous cultural data & languages.

I'm currently the only director & person on the project but will be hugely ramping up efforts on this due to it's potential positive impact.

I have also started to develop [AIOR](#AIOR) because of it - an AI orchestration research tool to enable mass data model research & generation.
